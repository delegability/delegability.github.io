# Task Delegability to AI
Which tasks are people comfortable delegating to an AI?
If not comfortable with complete delegation, how much help would they like?
What would make them more comfortable?

By understanding peoples' preferences, the reasons behind these preferences, and how these preferences change over time, we hope to understand how to use machine learning and AI technologies in a more human-centered way.

Have an idea to improve the framework or the survey? Have your own ideas on which tasks are delegable, which differ from our data? We welcome contribution!
